# IDE

**As a web developer an IDE (Integrated development environment) is an absolute must! Since there is a whole lot of software available on the market, it is very important that you find one that fits your style of coding...**

## Goals
Getting an insight into the available IDE's
Make an informed decision for the right IDE
Have an IDE for the rest of the training

Search for different IDE's online
Think about the pros and cons of your chosen IDE and prepare a readme.md
Push that readme.md to a new repository, call it IDE-research
Make sure the repository is public (*)
Make sure the readme has at least:
A download link of the IDE
Three positives
Three negatives
No.1 Reason why you chose this IDE

## Why 

As an anonymous woman once said :point_up:

> Make time now to do it right
> Or make time later to do it over

## Info

An IDE is more than a simple text editor. While code-centric text editors such as *Sublime* of *Atom* offer many convenient features such as syntax highlighting, customizable interfaces and extensive navigation tools, they only allow you to write code. To make functioning applications, you at least need a compiler and a debugger.

An IDE includes all of these components and then more. Some IDEs come with additional tools for automating, testing and visualizing the development process. The term “integrated development environment” means that you have everything you need to **turn code into functioning apps and programs**.

Which is the best IDE on the market? The better question is: “Which is the best IDE for my purposes?” General factors to consider when choosing the best IDE include the languages it can support, ease of use and cost.
