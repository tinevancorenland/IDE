# IDE

**As a web developer an IDE (Integrated development environment) is an absolute must! Since there is a whole lot of software available on the market, it is very important that you find one that fits your style of coding...**

## Goals

 - [x] Search for different IDE's online

 - [x] Compare and make an informed decision for the right IDE

 - [ ] Have an IDE for the rest of the training




Make sure the readme has at least:
A download link of the IDE



## Why 

As an anonymous woman once said :point_up:

> Make time now to do it right
> Or make time later to do it over

## Info

An IDE is more than a simple text editor. While code-centric text editors such as *Sublime* of *Atom* offer many convenient features such as syntax highlighting, customizable interfaces and extensive navigation tools, they only allow you to write code. To make functioning applications, you at least need a compiler and a debugger.

An IDE includes all of these components and then more. Some IDEs come with additional tools for automating, testing and visualizing the development process. The term “integrated development environment” means that you have everything you need to **turn code into functioning apps and programs**.

Which is the best IDE on the market? The better question is: “Which is the best IDE for my purposes?” General factors to consider when choosing the best IDE include the languages it can support, ease of use and cost.

Check out the list below outlining the features and drawbacks of each of 10  IDE software programs.

## Pro's and cons of Visual Studio Code

Pros | Cons
--------------- | --------------- 
User friendly layout and attractive interface | Lacks some features of a full IDE
Easily customizable | Slow file search
Thousands of plugins/extensions available through the VS Code Marketplace | Longer launch time than most of its competitors

I have chosen to use Visual Studio Code, because it works as a fairly lightweight text editor, but with more powerful IDE-type features (such as a debugger) with very minimal configuration. It is also commonly used so if I encouter any problems I can google my way out of them.
